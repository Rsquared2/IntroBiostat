This file describes guidelines when the textbook's source files are modified and/or shared. The CC BY-SA license guidelines supercede any guidelines put forth in this file; follow the CC BY-SA license if there is any discrepency between that license and these guidelines.

Please note that materials previously downloaded under a CC BY-NC-SA license may either (A) follow the CC BY-NC-SA license and previous guidelines set forth in http://www.openintro.org/perm/stat2nd_v1.txt OR (B) follow the CC BY-SA license and the guidelines set forth in this file. All newly downloaded materials fall under the CC BY-SA license and new guidelines. Please also note that a derivative product released by developers unaffiliated with OpenIntro will follow either option (A) or option (B), and that option cannot be changed in subsequent derivatives without the permission of these other developers.

1. Communication obligation. Any derivative work must communicate that it is licensed under a CC BY-SA license, and it also must include the following link (a copy of this file) so authors making further derivatives may understand the attribution guidelines put forth by the original authors:

http://www.openintro.org/perm/stat2nd_v2.txt

Additional attribution (e.g. citing the original work) may be necessary depending on how the source materials are used. See the CC BY-SA licese for additional details.

2. Figure attribution. Some photographs from OpenIntro Statistics are owned by other creators who made the images available under a Creative Commons license. If you use a photograph, please check in the textbook whether the figure is a work of another party. If you use any such images, provide appropriate attribution to the original photographer (e.g. see OpenIntro Statistics for what we believe to be appropriate attribution in these instances).

3. Derivative title. No derivative may include "OpenIntro" in the title, unless it is included in text of the form "Derivative of OpenIntro", e.g. one might add a subtitle that includes "Derivative of OpenIntro Statistics, Second Edition". This includes all unofficially printed copies of OpenIntro Statistics or electronic versions that have been in anyway reformatted or converted to another file type. If you wish to distribute copies under the title "OpenIntro Statistics", please contact OpenIntro staff (www.openintro.org/about.php). Use of the OpenIntro logo is strictly prohibited (the logo is not licensed for use).

4. Defining commercial. [Recent versions of OpenIntro Statisics are available under a CC BY-SA license. This section of the ReadMe file relates to prior file versions and no longer applies to the new licensed content.]

5. Below are other suggested guidelines for attribution.

- The first two pages of any derivative work should be the title page and the copyright page. We encourage contributors to use the following two files provided in the textbook's source: file, extraTeX > preamble > title, copyright.

- We advise that contributing authors' names be listed in chronological order corresponding to their contribution. We also encourage contributing authors to provide a brief description of their contribution.
